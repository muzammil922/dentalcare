# Dental Clinic Management System - Setup Guide

## Issues Fixed

The main issues that were fixed:

1. **Missing Firebase Configuration File**: Created `js/firebase-config.js` with proper error handling and local storage fallback
2. **Duplicate HTML IDs**: Removed duplicate patient modal that was causing conflicts
3. **HTML Structure**: Cleaned up the HTML structure and ensured all tags are properly closed

## Quick Start

1. **Open the application**:
   - Simply open `index.html` in your web browser
   - Or run a local server: `python -m http.server 8000` and visit `http://localhost:8000`

2. **Firebase Setup** (Optional):
   - Edit `js/firebase-config.js` and replace the placeholder values with your Firebase project credentials
   - If Firebase is not configured, the app will automatically use local storage as a fallback

3. **Features Available**:
   - Dashboard with statistics
   - Patient management
   - Appointment scheduling
   - Billing and invoicing
   - Staff management
   - Attendance tracking
   - Salary management
   - Automation settings
   - Feedback collection
